# Nexus 4 navigation buttons fix

**Build for Android 5.1.1 (LMY48T) now available!**

If you want to promote this fix for your custom ROM maintainer follow this [Patch](https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/147266).

# VERY IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

I have no longer a phone to reproduce or test the issue. All releases after 5.1.0 built in hope for best of luck. There is **NO WARRANTY AT ALL** and I will not respond on feedback like "I tried your patch, but it didn't work, WTF?!". I know that dead zones varies across broken touch screens and I'm not in guilty that some phone has bigger irresponsive area.
